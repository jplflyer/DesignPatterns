# Design Patterns
There are roughly 22 well-known and somewhat well-understood design patterns in computer programming. While looking at the list recently, I realized I only knew a few of the patterns well enough to explain them and had never knowingly used some of them. When talking to my coworkers, I found I wasn't the only one. So we're going to get together periodically to deep-dive into one design pattern at a time.

The notes and code for each pattern we address will be found in a directory named after the pattern. First up is Visitor.
